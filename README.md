twitter_api_examples
====================

Oauth, search and status update/delete examples for twitter API 1.1

This class is not meant to be a full, working library by any stretch of the imagination. It is merely a starting point
for coders wishing to interact with the twitter api 1.1 on their own without relying on a third party. Getting 
all the auth stuff to work correctly is a bitch, so hopefully my code will help others who are going down that road.

The code is 100% open and free, but I make no guarantees to its completeness, utility or anything else. It is what it is.
